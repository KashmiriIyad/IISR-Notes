I created this repository to showcase the success of my website, developed over three years during my studies.


International Indian School Riyadh (IISR), located in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, was where I studied from 2019 to 2024. During my time there, the COVID-19 pandemic caused students to stay home 24/7 due to lockdowns, leading to increased laziness and dullness. Even after normal life resumed, students were reluctant to write their own notes, relying instead on digitalized printed materials for their studies.

When the time of examination arrived, students got worried and stole notebooks from other students (I was one of them) and took them for long time. I thought if I had enough potential in my hands, why don't I just make a website and upload all my handwritten notes in their so people would access it?

### Then the plan began, 

In 2019, as a 9th grader, I scoured the internet for a hosting server and eventually discovered WordPress. Navigating the challenges of learning new skills and designing the site was time-consuming, especially while balancing my studies. Fast forwarding, we reach a point where I successfully setup the site. I advertised the site from my class group and everyone was delightful of this project. Day by day, I uploaded new notes and people used to download and study on them. 


### Then, we hit big numbers;
I got popular in boy section, students were carrying my photocopies of my notes which then were noticed by the teachers and supervisiors. Teachers were supportive and happy about it, but, didn't lasted well..

In examinations, students were caught cheating by keeping the photocopies of my notes under their desks. Seeing your notes scattered on the floor. Mistakes on my notebook which made other people do the same and it goes on. These issues were solved easily by temporary shutting down the webpage on examinations, reducing the time period of notes being uploaded to web, and rectifying my own mistakes.

### 2021; Grade X

No major problems, only the website used to hit 50-100s views everyday. The number used to increase more during weekends and at the time of exams, which eventually led my name to the main office of school.

### 2022; Grade XI

I expanded the coverage of biology, P.Ed, and commerce notes, but inconsistencies in the content caused biology to be the first to falter. Later, my teachers discarded both the P.Ed and commerce notes, as they came from the girls' section and didn't align well with the boys' section notes. All three subjects were taken down over the course of three months. The other notes, they worked fine as it was.

### 2023; Grade XII

More students began copying during exams, especially in physics and computer science, which angered the teachers and prompted them to tell me to stop. Additionally, other schools had been accessing our notes, and the teachers insisted that we shouldn't share our materials with them. I found this reasonable and ultimately decided to shut down the website.

## Statistics

### My website used to garner over 6,000 views annually, with total all-time stats reaching around 17,000 views.

## Conclusion;

It was a great project, and I found joy in helping others while they helped me in return. Seeing students carry my notes in their bags made me happy, knowing my website was making a real impact. My journey with IISR was truly remarkable, especially as I navigated through all these experiences. The website was ultimately closed on May 24th, 2023.
