I created this repository to showcase the success of my website, developed over three years during my studies.

International Indian School Riyadh (IISR) is located in the heart of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. I was a student who joined from year 2019 to '24, I completed my studies in this school. During my time, students became lazy and dull due to COVID-19 pandamic which caused them to stay in their homes 24/7 due to lockdown. After when normal life was resumed, students weren't ready to write notes of their own and managed to study from digitalized printed notes.

When the time of examination arrived, students got worried and stole notebooks from other students (I was one of them) and took them for long time. I thought if I had enough potential in my hands, why don't I just make a website and upload all my handwritten notes in their so people would access it?

### Then the plan began, 

In 2019, as a 9th grader, I scoured the internet for a hosting server and eventually discovered WordPress. Navigating the challenges of learning new skills and designing the site was time-consuming, especially while balancing my studies. Fast forwarding, we reach a point where I successfully setup the site. I advertised the site from my class group and everyone was delightful of this project. Day by day, I uploaded new notes and people used to download and study on them. 


### Then, we hit big numbers;
I got popular in boy section, students were carrying my photocopies of my notes which then were noticed by the teachers and supervisiors. Teachers were supportive and happy about it, but, didn't lasted well..

In examinations, students were caught cheating by keeping the photocopies of my notes under their desks. Seeing your notes scattered on the floor. Mistakes on my notebook which made other people do the same and it goes on. These issues were solved easily by temporary shutting down the webpage on examinations, reducing the time period of notes being uploaded to web, and rectifying my own mistakes.

### 2022; Grade X

No major problems, only the website used to hit 50-100s views everyday. The number used to increase more during weekends and at the time of exams, which eventually my name to the main office of school.

### 2023; Grade XI
